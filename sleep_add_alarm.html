Dear Sir/Madam,

I am an applicant of your MSc Business Analytics program who sincerely want to be a member of your community. My CID is 01901564. Unfortunately, I received your waitlist letter several days ago. Since Imperial College London is my dream university, I will wait your decision patiently. 

Academic capacity is of crucial importance to a studentâ€™s development, so I always try my best to absorb various knowledge. As suffered from broken bones in the fall 2019, I could not take the Text Mining Technology class, instead, I preferred to attend the CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning online course offered by Stanford University (https://github.com/oxford-cs-deepnlp-2017/lectures) and the Deep NLP online course offered by Oxford University (http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/). Through the Real-time online Question and Answer System, I could communicate with the professors conveniently.  

Genuine knowledge comes from practice. In the end of the class, the professor required us to attend the Kaggle Competition as the final course assignment of the Text Mining Technology. Kaggle is the world's largest data science community with powerful tools and resources to help the competitors achieve the data science goals. My project involved in the Natural Language Inference (NLI), one of the hot topics of NLP. The task was to predict the relationship of two sentence: sent1 and sent2. Three are three candidate relations: contradiction, entailment, and neutral. The sponsor of Kaggle gave us 20,000 sentence pairs for training, 5,000 sentence pairs for testing. I divided the training pairs to train and dev, and then conducted the data loading and preprocessing. Then I rewrote and applied the deep learning and neural network algorithm to predict the label of the given sentence pairs for testing. Due to the lack of data, I also made data cleaning and the algorithm fine-tuning by using the Bert model, and then predicted the sentence label. When I uploaded the label to the Kaggle platform, the Kaggle would contract my label with the standard label. Eventually, I won the 5th place in the Kaggle Competition. Since the final score of the Text Mining Technology was given according to the rank of the Kaggle competition, my professor gave me a high mark of 95/100 considering my excellent performance in the competition. My overall GPA also reaches to 85.27% at present. I think this experience may add some weight to your consideration of my application if there are still vacancies. And I will be honored if you need to make a further discussion about this competition or other projects I had conducted with me. 

Thanks a lot and I am still waiting for your final decision.

Yours sincerely,
Chang Yinuo
